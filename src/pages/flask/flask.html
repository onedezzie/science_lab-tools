      Flasks are useful tools for containing liquid and performing mixing,
       heating, cooling, precipitation, condensation and other processes.
      Their size are chosen by the volume they can hold, and is measured in metric units, 
      like litres (L) or mililitres (mL). Their shape depends on what they are used for,
       but they usually consist of a wider body, which contains the materials, and a more
       narrow neck with an opening at the top. The opening is the way to insert materials into the body.
       Some flasks have more than one neck and opening at the top.
